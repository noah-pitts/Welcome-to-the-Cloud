# Welcome-to-the-Cloud
A series of DBX notebooks I created for my friends/family to get them into the Cloud using the [Databricks Community Edition](https://www.databricks.com/product/faq/community-edition)!

I picked DBX community edition because its free and quick to set up.

Here are the docs on how to set it up [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/community-edition.html)

Here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxghcAAI3F8) I followed when setting it up.

Happy Learning!
